extra-cmake-modules (Extra modules and scripts for CMake)

Extra modules and scripts for CMake.
Extra CMake Modules, or ECM, aims to augment CMake with additional
modules. It serves as both a staging ground for new modules before
they are moved upstream to CMake and a place for modules that, for
whatever reason, are not a good fit for CMake itself.
