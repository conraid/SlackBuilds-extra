# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

extra-cmake-modules: Extra CMake Modules, or ECM, aims to augment CMake with additional
extra-cmake-modules: modules. It serves as both a staging ground for new modules before
extra-cmake-modules: they are moved upstream to CMake and a place for modules that, for
extra-cmake-modules: whatever reason, are not a good fit for CMake itself.
