poppler-qt6 (a qt6 library for rendering PDF documents)

Poppler is a library based on the xpdf PDF viewer developed by Derek
Noonburg of Glyph and Cog, LLC. Since xpdf does not provide a shared
library, whenever a flaw was found potentially dozens of applications
incorporating code from xpdf would have to be patched. By providing
a centralized PDF library this duplicated effort will be eliminated.
